              <p>
                As an independent insurance intermediary, We act as Your agent.
                For the avoidance of doubt, We are not the agents of the
                insurer. We will not deliberately put Ourselves in a position
                where Our interests, or Our duty to another party, prevent Us
                from discharging Our duty to clients.  City Marine maintains
                internal procedures and controls to identify and manage any
                potential conflicts, so that at all times the interests of all
                of City Marine's clients are reasonably protected.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the event that Our interests’ conflict with a duty We owe to
                You, We shall refrain from taking any action until We have
                received Your informed consent to Our intended course of action.
              </p>

              <p className="fw-normal">2.3. Obtaining Terms</p>

              <p>
                City Marine will act as Your insurance broker.  We look to
                establish a proper understanding of your insurance requirements
                including the scope of cover, limits sought, cost of cover and
                choice of insurers. We will keep You informed about Our progress
                and identify where We are unable to meet Your requirements.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will provide You with the information You need to make a
                decision about the insurance cover available. However, all
                decisions regarding the amount (including sums insured), type or
                terms of insurance covers and contract limits shall be Your sole
                responsibility. While City Marine may provide advice and
                recommendations, You must decide on the specific coverage that
                is appropriate for Your particular circumstances and financial
                position. You must let Us know in writing if You would like to
                increase or modify Your insurance cover in any way.
              </p>

              <p>
                City Marine does not assume any liability for the effectiveness
                or completeness of Your existing insurance program (if any) or
                any insurance policies placed by You directly or by another
                insurance broker or for any acts or omissions occurring prior to
                the date of commencement of City Marine's engagement.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unless specifically agreed in writing, We are not responsible
                for and will not review insurance policies We did not place for
                You or other work done before We became Your insurance broker.
              </p>

              <p className="fw-normal">2.4. Provision of Documentation</p>

              <p>
                We will provide You with written policy documentation in a
                timely manner once We have completed Your insurance(s) (We are
                not responsible for any delays in providing the policy caused by
                the insurers). This will be the evidence of insurance We have
                arranged, and may take the form of an insurer document, cover
                note or a broker insurance document which provides confirmation
                of the terms of the insurance contract We have arranged, and
                where applicable a schedule of insurer(s) with whom the risk has
                been placed. Your policy documentation will also be accompanied
                with a debit note for the premium billing. As more fully
                described below, it is Your responsibility promptly to check
                this and notify Us if it does not meet Your requirements.
              </p>

              <p>
                Any paper documents that You may provide to Us will be treated
                as copy documents. It is our policy to retain documents for
                business effected on Your behalf in electronic or paper format
                for a minimum of 3 years, after which time such documents may
                ultimately be destroyed by Us in accordance with Our
                documentation retention policy. For some types of insurance
                cover, it is possible that a claim may be made under a policy
                long after its expiry date and it is therefore important that
                You keep such documents safe. Please let us know if You require
                any further information.
              </p>

              <p>
                Any original placing slip evidencing insurance placed by Us on
                Your behalf shall belong to Us.
              </p>

              <p className="fw-normal">2.5. Debit Note</p>

              <p>
                Our debit note (or equivalent document) will show the premium,
                and, where relevant, any insurance premium tax, Value-added tax
                (VAT), other taxes, duty or other charge which needs to be
                remitted to the appropriate authorities by insurers, or which is
                allowed by insurers to be deducted from the premium payable. If
                a tax, duty or other charge becomes payable as a result of the
                insurance contract and is in excess of the gross premium or
                allowed to be deducted by You from the premium payable, it is
                Your responsibility to ensure that it is remitted to the
                appropriate authorities(s), unless otherwise stated in Our debit
                note.  For all tax related information, You should refer to the
                insurer’s invoice; Our debit note will merely notify You of the
                payable amount.
              </p>

              <p className="fw-normal">2.6. Midterm Amendments and Adjustments</p>

              <p>
                Any changes to Your circumstances that could impact Your
                insurance needs or ability to comply with the terms of Your
                insurance policy must be raised with Us promptly and We request
                that any amendments to the insurance contract be communicated to
                Us in writing. We will then use Our best endeavours to get
                insurer’s agreement to these changes and We will confirm this
                back to You, including any additional or return premium
                attributable to the changes, by way of an addendum or
                endorsement.

              <p>
                The insurers We use are regulated by the relevant authorities
                and are required to hold adequate capital resources.  We assess
                both local and international insurers and markets with whom We
                place business, using public information including that produced
                by recognised rating agencies. We will draw to your attention
                the lack of published financial rating or inadequately rated
                insurers however We do not, guarantee or otherwise warrant the
                solvency of any insurer or market used for Your requirements.
                The decision regarding suitability of any insurer or market
                rests solely with You. If You have any concerns, regarding any
                insurer chosen for Your insurance requirements You must advise
                Us as soon as possible and We will discuss them with You. If a
                participating insurer becomes insolvent, You may still be liable
                to pay the premium, whether in full or pro-rata. We deny any
                liability in the event of the insurer becoming insolvent.

              <p>
                City Marine makes every effort to correctly determine the
                premium and (if applicable) statutory charges that apply to Your
                insurance. However, occasionally errors can occur, for example,
                where We make an unintentional error or because a third party
                advises Us of the wrong amount. Please note that We retain the
                right to correct any such error and You agree, to the extent
                permitted by law, not to hold City Marine responsible for any
                loss You may suffer as a result of the error and its correction.

                so that We can understand Your requirements. Certain classNamees

                documents accurately. Whilst We may give guidance regarding the

              <p>
                An insurance contract is one of the utmost good faith. You owe a
                legal duty to make a fair presentation of the risk to the
                insurer. You have a duty to disclose to the insurer every
                material circumstance which You know or ought to know after a
                reasonable search or which is sufficient to put the insurer on
                notice that it needs to make further enquiries for the purpose
                of revealing those material circumstances. In addition, You have
                a duty to disclose information in a clear and accessible manner.
              </p>

              <p>
                This duty of disclosure applies before the start of cover, when
                all material information must be disclosed to insurers to enable
                terms to be negotiated and cover arranged. This is not limited
                to answering specific questions that may be asked. Any material
                changes which may occur or come to light after a quotation has
                been given must also be notified to Us and Your insurers. You
                should not rely on casual observation of any material aspect of
                the risk by Us or any other third party as satisfying Your
                obligation to disclose material matters concerning Your cover.
              </p>

              <p>
                A circumstance is material if it would influence a prudent
                insurer’s judgment in determining whether to underwrite the risk
                and, if so, on what terms.

                It is Your responsibility to check the documentation We send You
                in relation to each insurance contract and satisfy Yourself that
                it is entirely in accordance with Your understanding and
                instructions. You should advise Us promptly of any incorrect
                points or changes required. Otherwise, We will assume that the
                documentation and insurance contract satisfy Your requirements.
              </p>

              <p>
                We can only agree to bind an insurance contract on Your behalf
                upon receipt of formal written instructions from You.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is important that You keep Your insurance documents safe.

              <p>
                It is important that You are clear and understand all the terms
                of any insurance contract that We provide to You. It is also
                important that You treat all warranties (a warranty being a
                guarantee that the facts stated are true and reliable and may be
                continuing) seriously and comply strictly with them. Failure to
                do so may entitle the insurer to decline a claim under the
                policy. If You have any doubts or reservations, You should tell
                Us.
              </p>

              <p>
                A subjectivity in Your insurance contract may lead to the
                contract being invalidated or coverage prejudiced if the
                subjectivity remains outstanding. It is very important that You
                promptly satisfy any subjectivity so that it can be removed.
              </p>

              <p className="fw-normal">3.5. Payment Terms</p>

              <p>
                In order for Us to meet an insurer’s premium payment terms, You
                agree to pay and settle premiums to Us or directly to insurers
                (depending on the local requirements) by the payment date(s)
                specified in Our debit note or any other relevant document.
              </p>

              <p>
                We draw particular attention to the premium payment warranty
                under the policy, which is mandatory to be complied with. If You
                believe that You will not be able to meet any such terms,
                warranties or conditions, You should notify Us immediately.
              </p>

              <p>
                Should You fail to pay the premium or any instalments of it in
                full and cleared funds in the invoiced currency by the due date,
                the insurance contract may be cancelled by Us or by insurers in
                accordance with any cancellation clause in the policy.

                When conducting Your business, We may have to convert funds to
                another currency in order to settle amounts due to insurers. If
                a repayment of funds is due to You or is requested by You after
                conversion, then any such repayment will be made in the currency
                to which the funds have been converted. Any shortfall arising
                from exchange differences remains Your liability (including any
                charges that We have may to incur in remitting the funds back to

                If You pay a premium in a different currency or to a bank

                Our discretion, either return the funds to You or convert the
                money to the required currency. In the latter case, the
                converted funds will be applied against the amount due with any
                shortfall arising from exchange differences remaining Your
                liability.

                may need to disclose Your information to a range of third
                parties for the purposes of obtaining (re)insurance or employee
                benefit quotations as applicable, arranging, placing or
                administering cover for You, or providing any other related
                services. These third parties may include, where applicable,
                (re)insurers, other intermediaries, risk management assessors,
                uninsured loss recovery agencies, service providers, industry
                regulators, anti-fraud organisations, credit reference agencies,

                Many of these third parties receive and process personal data as
                controllers in their own right and are therefore independently
                responsible for the processing they undertake, but where a third
                party receives personal data as Our processor, We shall ensure
                that We satisfy the applicable requirements under applicable
                Data Protection Law. Where We agree to make a third-party
                platform or portal available to You, We retain responsibility
                for any personal data collected through that channel.

                Where such disclosures necessitate transfers of personal data to
                third party recipients outside of the UAE, We will ensure that
                personal data is protected as required by Data Protection Law.
                This may include adopting permitted transfer mechanism.
